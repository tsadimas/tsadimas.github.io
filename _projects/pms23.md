The course aims to provide the required theoretical training and practical, laboratory training to the students, so that they are able to deal with the issue of developing a PS with proficiency. Emphasis is placed on the basic principles and processes that must be followed in all development phases: Planning Phase (project plan), Analysis Phase (requirements determination, process and data modeling), Design Phase (architecture, user interface), Implementation Phase (management development, testing, documentation, migration). Emphasis is also placed on object-oriented analysis and design using UML.

The course takes a realistic approach to the analysis and design of systems which proceeds as in a real system in order for students to see all the stages of the analysis and design of an Information System and to apply them in practice.

  abstract={Model-based system design is served by a single, multi-layered model supporting all design activities, in different levels of detail. SysML is a modeling language, endorsed by OMG, for system engineering, which aims at defining such models for system design. It provides discrete diagrams to describe system structure and components, to explore allocation policies crucial for system design, and to identify design requirements. In this chapter, SysML is used for the model-based design of enterprise information system architecture, supporting a systemic view of such systems, where software and hardware entities are treated as system components composed to create the system architecture. SysML extensions to facilitate the effective description of non-functional requirements, especially quantitative ones, and their verification are presented. The integration of evaluation parameters and results into a discrete SysML diagram enhances the requirement verification process, while the visualization of evaluation data helps system engineers to explore design decisions and properly adjust system design. Based on the proposed extensions, a SysML profile is developed. The experience obtained when applying the profile for renovating the architecture of a large-scale enterprise information system is also briefly discussed to explore the potential of the proposed extensions.},

  title={Extending SysML to Integrate Cost Analysis Into Model-Based Systems Engineering}, 
  year={2022},
  abstract={Model-based systems design (MBSD), a current trend adopted by INCOSE, employs the systems modeling language (SysML), a standard introduced by OMG and INCOSE. Though there are numerous works on integrating performance exploitation in SysML, cost is not sufficiently explored as a driving design parameter. By integrating cost analysis in a popular modeling language like SysML, the proposed approach may be applied to any system designed using standardized languages and tools. In this work, we integrate cost analysis within SysML models at a generic level to explore design alternatives under specific cost and performance restrictions and perform tradeoff analysis. The proposed SysML extensions provide: 1) cost-related entities to encode cost aspects, such as capital and operating expenses, and 2) functions that enable the automatic computation of costs; these extensions are contained in a custom SysML cost profile. The feasibility and benefits of the approach are explored in two distinct real-world case studies with different purpose and characteristics. 1) Configuring a remote elderly monitoring system, taking into consideration patients' budgetary and operational concerns regarding the equipment installed in their homes. In this case, patients had the opportunity to evaluate and prioritize their concerns prior to using the system. 2) Exploring the improvement of the passengers' comfort as a level of service indicator in the Athens Metro railway system, taking into account operational cost constraints. In this case, the operator obtained forecasts of performance and cost of the metro system operation in order to choose between different operational policies.},

  title={A Declarative Approach for Transforming SysML Models to Executable Simulation Models}, 
  year={2021},
  abstract={Systems Modeling Language (SysML) is an object management group standard for systems-of-systems engineering. It enables the description of complex system models; however, it cannot effectively support all system engineering activities. For instance, system performance evaluation is usually performed via simulation. In this case, the transformation of SysML system models to executable simulation models for specific simulation methodologies and tools is required. Model transformation is a key component for addressing the challenges of seamless integration of SysML model simulation in model-based system engineering. In this paper, we explore a declarative approach, based on the query/view/transformation-relations (QVT-R) standard, for the transformation of SysML models to executable simulation models, fully adhering model-driven architecture (MDA) concepts. It is supported by a framework implemented to provide executable simulation model and code generation. Methodological guidelines, for the effective use of a declarative language as QVT-R, for model transformation, are provided, emphasizing the utilization of existing domain-specific SysML profiles, as well as executable simulation library components. The experience obtained from two different domains, namely, enterprise information and railway transportation systems, modeled as systems-of-systems via SysML, is discussed, based on a quantitative analysis of the respective QVT-R transformations.},

  abstract={The concept of Level of Service (LoS) is not inherently supported by Systems Modeling Language (SysML), the standard modeling notation for model‐based systems engineering. This paper describes and demonstrates an approach that enhances SysML to enable LoS modeling and evaluation. A SysML profile enables the definition and visual verification of LoS during system operation, via LoS specific requirements, inside the system model, and the association of these requirements with specific system components. Hence, static and dynamic aspects of the system model are used for the LoS verification, while specific design alternatives are automatically proposed, in case the desired LoS is not achieved. As a proof of concept, the proposed approach was applied to explore passenger comfort, a key LoS metric, indicating space available to passenger in Railway Transportation Systems (RTSs). A specific case study on passenger comfort for the Athens Metro was conducted to derive insights regarding the practical aspects of the proposed approach.},

  title={Providing Designers with Automated Decision-Making within SysML Models to Promote Efficient Model-Based Systems Design}, 
  abstract={Systems of Systems (SoS) design is a complex process that involves, among other activities, the specification of system structure and requirements, the analysis of behavior and performance, and the exploration of the most appropriate system design solutions. Integration of these activities is advocated by Model-Based Systems Design (MBSD), where a core system model can be enriched with additional capabilities, such as performance analysis or decision-making. The Systems Modeling Language (SysML) is a standard language to utilize model-based design of SoS and create system models, specifying requirements and system constraints. In this work, we focus on integrating decision-making capabilities into SysML to enable system designers to explore alternative solutions that fit the requirements described in SysML. The system model is transformed to a decision model, whose results are automatically incorporated back into the system model. The proposed approach runs iteratively on any typical SysML model and facilitates the designer to explore alternative design solutions, minimizing the manual effort needed to achieve them. As a case study, the approach is applied in the design of a remote patient monitoring system, namely the Remote Elderly Monitoring System (REMS), where the designer decides on a system configuration that covers the needs of the patients.},

  abstract={A Cyber-Physical Human System (CPHS) comprises software, hardware and the human, allowing interactions between them. While such systems become more complex, it is crucial to consider the human factor during their design, addressing human concerns. In previous work, the authors attempted to translate human concerns into criticalities, e.g., design requirements depicting human concerns, restricting CPHS usage. Here, an approach is proposed, aiming to facilitate the designer of CPHSs to integrate criticalities into the design process. This enables a more efficient design. For this purpose, we introduce a model-based approach adopting Object Management Group (OMG) standards, such as Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), and Systems Modeling Language (SysML), to explore CPHS design and identify discrete views, representing both human and system aspects. Moreover, we explore the applicability of the proposed approach in the design of a Remote Elderly Monitoring System (REMS), where it is essential for the human to become part of the system wearing medical sensors. The identification of human criticalities during REMS design enabled the designer to evaluate different configurations considering human concerns.},

abstract="Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) comprise multiple cyberparts, physical processes, and human participants (end-users) that affect them, and vice versa. During the design of such systems, it is critical for the designer to take into account the end-user-perceived quality of provided services, as well as their cost, and integrate them into the CPSs; striking a satisfactory balance between quality and affordability is critical to system acceptance. In this work, we propose a model-based approach, using the Systems Modeling Language (SysML), to explore system design, encapsulating Quality of Service (QoS) and cost aspects, as system requirements, into a core model. Via this approach, the designer can define the system structure, configure it, measure and evaluate the quality, while analyzing cost, and find the best solution(s) for a correct design. As a use case, this approach is applied to a healthcare CPS, namely the Remote Elderly Monitoring System (REMS). In that context, managing REMS QoS and cost requirements, can contribute to an effective system design and implementation, enhancing the end-user satisfaction.",

  title={Exploring LoS in railway transportation systems using SysML}, 
  abstract={Railway Transportation Systems (RTSs) are systems of high complexity consisting of other systems. Thus, they may be studied as Systems-of-Systems (SoS) using the Systems Modeling Language (SysML). Since their purpose is to provide transportation services that have a critical role in urban societies and affect millions of users, they have to be precisely evaluated, focusing on their adequacy to deliver the expected service quality. In the case of RTSs, service quality is expressed by Level of Service (LoS) indicators related to the passenger's experience within RTS components, such as stations and trains. Such indicators express, for example, space and time restrictions, and are standardized in international bodies. In this paper, an approach, integrating LoS concepts in Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), is proposed, enabling the description and verification of LoS requirements for RTS SysML models. Exploiting SysML, a RTS model can be generated, populated with basic transportation entities and specific LoS requirements associated to them. Requirements are described in a simple, abstract fashion by the RTS engineer, while more specific requirements are automatically generated and associated with basic RTS components. Furthermore, verification of RTS LoS is facilitated, helping the system designer to assess alternative RTS operation scenarios. In this context, a case study discussing the Athens Metro System is briefly examined.},

Since cloud computing is an innovative business model, whose deployment is accompanied by huge investments, a thorough, multilevel cost analysis of provided services is vital. Such an analysis should focus, among others, on demand forecasting for computational resources and financial assessment of cloud computing investments, estimating crucial economic parameters, such as Net Present Value (NPV), Return of Investment (ROI) and Total Cost of Ownership (TCO). Into this context, a model-driven techno-economic approach is introduced in this paper targeting the estimation of economic parameters of cloud service deployment, which is able to assist decision support procedures for cloud users, cloud providers and cloud brokers. SysML is adopted as a modeling language for describing cloud architectures as system-of-systems (SoS), emphasizing cost properties.

	Abstract				 = {Enterprise information system architecture design is the process of defining and optimizing its structure (both software and hardware) to effectively support provided functionality. System architects are combining software and hardware vital components, usually defined by other stakeholders, and are dealing with both functional and non functional requirements. Alternative architecture solution evaluation is usually a part of the design process, aiming to determine if the defined requirements are satisfied. A model-based approach, constituted of discrete views, each of which facilitates a discrete design task, has been proposed, while Systems Modeling Language (SysML) has been adopted for the model representation. In this paper, emphasis is given on the Evaluation View, aiming at the exploration of alternative software and hardware combination scenarios proposed in other views. The view facilitates the management of simulation experiments and results and the verification of predefined requirements. A case study, where the proposed model-based design approach has been applied is also discussed.},

	Abstract				 = {Information system architecture design is a complex task depending on both functional and non-functional requirements. Since system architecture definition is strongly related to system performance, non-functional requirements play a significant role during enterprise information system design. To explore the effect of non-functional requirements on system design process, a model-based approach emphasizing non-functional requirements is proposed. To facilitate the designer to effectively define and handle requirements during architecture design, a number of system views are offered, each of them focusing on discrete design issues and satisfying different kind of requirements. A consistent requirement model is defined representing how non-functional requirements are related between them and to system components forming the overall system architecture. SysML has been adopted as the modeling language, since it enables requirement definition and can be formally extended. Moreover, requirement derivation process is discussed and a case study where the proposed concepts are applied in practice while redesigning the legacy system of a large-scale organization is presented.},

However, in order to integrate them in an enterprise architecture, model-based engineering can be adopted. In such a case, a central system model is defined supporting all engineering activities. Zachman's matrix may be used as a basis for constructing such a model. Based on this assumption, we propose a systematic approach for the support of model-based EIS engineering process using Zachman matrix as EIS central model. Basic EIS engineering activities and the way they may be served by specific rows is explored, while the contribution of each system aspect (matrix column) is also taken into account. A conceptual model for model-based EIS engineering is also introduced. To explore the proposed concepts in practice, the system network cell is used as an example. Corresponding engineering tasks and sub-models are formed based on the proposed guidelines in a technology and methodology independent fashion. A case study based on the proposed concepts is also presented.},

	abstract={Extension mechanisms offered by UML 2.0 are often explored in order to define UML profiles that serve specific modeling purposes. These UML 2.0 profiles should be effectively accommodated by standard UML-based modeling tools, which provide the means for applying them in practice. Almost every UML 2.0 modeling tool supports the definition of stereotypes and the description of constraints in Object Constraint Language. However, implementing a profile in practice often entails the development of additional functionality. This requirement mainly stems from the fact that when dealing with complex models it is more efficient for end-users to help them enforce a constraint rather than notify them when it is broken. Such issues, encountered when developing a UML 2.0 profile for enterprise information systems engineering using Rational Software Modeler as a standard UML 2.0 modeling tool, are discussed in the paper.},

	abstract={Modern enterprise information systems are distributed systems usually built on multi-tiered client server architectures and can be defined using well-established frameworks such as the Zachman framework or the Open Distributed Processing Reference Model (RM-ODP). Both frameworks identify views regarding the system designer’s viewpoint, but they do not suggest a methodology for view creation. A consistent framework for enterprise information system engineering, compatible with both the Zachman framework and RM-ODP is proposed by the authors. It consists of a metamodel describing alternative system views, a corresponding methodology comprising discrete stages performed either by the system designer or software tools and a UML 2.0 profile for view representation. In this paper, a case study where the proposed framework was applied is discussed, focusing on the features provided to the system designer using the UML 2.0 profile. The profile is implemented by extending the Rational Software Modeler functionality. },

A four-stage methodology has been proposed in order to effectively explore configuration problems. A common metamodel for distributed system representation in all configuration stages is thus required, so that unclear dependencies between discrete stages can be easily identified. This model should also be easily adopted by autonomous software tools used for the automation of discrete configuration stages and for the efficient development of system specifications by designers. We propose such a metamodel using UML 2.0. More specifically, we introduce a UML 2.0 profile facilitating distributed system configuration process. In this profile, different UML 2.0 diagrams are integrated and properly extended, in order to model all aspects of the distributed system configuration process. Stereotypes proved to provide an efficient extension mechanism as no metamodel extensions were needed. This profile can also be used within the Rational Modeler platform. },

We propose a platform independent framework, which focuses on the Engineering Viewpoint of Enterprise Information Systems managing application configuration and network design issues independently of application development progress. In order to apply this framework using existing tools, model exchangeability and tool coordination must be supported by standard, open methods.

A four-stage methodology has been proposed in order to effectively explore configuration issues. The main advantage of the proposed methodology is the adoption of a common meta-model for the representation of systems throughout all configuration stages, ensuring interoperability and model consistency. In practice, configuration stages are supported by automated or semi-automated tools, each of which adopts its own meta-model for system representation. In order to apply the methodology using existing autonomous tools, model exchangeability (thus meta-model transformation) and tool co-ordination must be facilitated by standard, open methods. Thus, the common meta-model is implemented in a standard, exchangeable format, as XML. To provide a standard method to visualize the common meta-model, facilitate the designer to interact with it and co-ordinate specific tool invocation, a UML 2.0 profile was defined. Different UML 2.0 diagrams are integrated to support different views of the system. The representation of relationships and restrictions among discrete meta-model entities must be facilitated to identify and explore the dependencies between configuration stages.

abstract = {Nowadays there is a multitude of mobile and tablet applications being developed in order to facilitate or disrupt every day tasks. Many of these are location based. A technique to serve in providing information and content is crowdsourcing. This technique is based on the public contributing information or resources giving them the opportunity to become both service providers and recipients at the same time.Taking into account the above and after observing passengers using the public transport system, we came to the conclusion that it would be useful to be able to determine which transport medium (i.e which bus line out of a number running concurrently) is nearer at any given moment. This information allows for better decision making and choice of transportation.For this we propose the development of an application to show the position of a selected transport vehicle. The position will be calculated based on geo-tracking provided by passengers boarded on a vehicle. This will allow for real time information to the application users in order to be able to determine their optimal route.},

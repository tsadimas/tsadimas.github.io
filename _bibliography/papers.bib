abstract="Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) comprise multiple cyberparts, physical processes, and human participants (end-users) that affect them, and vice versa. During the design of such systems, it is critical for the designer to take into account the end-user-perceived quality of provided services, as well as their cost, and integrate them into the CPSs; striking a satisfactory balance between quality and affordability is critical to system acceptance. In this work, we propose a model-based approach, using the Systems Modeling Language (SysML), to explore system design, encapsulating Quality of Service (QoS) and cost aspects, as system requirements, into a core model. Via this approach, the designer can define the system structure, configure it, measure and evaluate the quality, while analyzing cost, and find the best solution(s) for a correct design. As a use case, this approach is applied to a healthcare CPS, namely the Remote Elderly Monitoring System (REMS). In that context, managing REMS QoS and cost requirements, can contribute to an effective system design and implementation, enhancing the end-user satisfaction.",

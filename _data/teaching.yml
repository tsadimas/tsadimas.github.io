      description: >
        The aim of the course is to become familiar with management, automation and monitoring tools for computing units (physical or virtual). Also cloud application management and development.
        Upon successful completion of the course, the student will be able to manage and automate several software installation/configuration processes as well as the preparation of the infrastructure and services that will support modern information systems.
        Sections git, automation tools (ansible), containers (docker, docker-compose), CI/CD tools (Jenkins), kubernetes, forward proxies/reverse proxies, application gateways, monitoring tools, microservices.

    - title: Information Systems Design and Development Methods
      institution: Harokopio University, Athens, Greece
      program: Informatics and Telematics
      year: Oct 2015 - now
      description: >
        The course aims to provide the required theoretical training and practical, laboratory training to the students, so that they are able to deal with the issue of developing a PS with proficiency. Emphasis is placed on the basic principles and processes that must be followed in all development phases: Planning Phase (project plan), Analysis Phase (requirements determination, process and data modeling), Design Phase (architecture, user interface), Implementation Phase (management development, testing, documentation, migration). Emphasis is also placed on object-oriented analysis and design using UML.
        The course takes a realistic approach to the analysis and design of systems which proceeds as in a real system in order for students to see all the stages of the analysis and design of an Information System and to apply them in practice.

        Developing applications with the logic of microservices (comes with a lab part using fastapi, which is an async web framework in python). User authentication schemes in web applications (OAuth2, JWT) and their integration. Introduction to container concepts. Use of docker (how we create docker images, how we use public repositories such as docker hub but also private ones). Running multiple microservices using docker-compose. Creation of virtual machines in cloud computing infrastructure (example with gcloud/azure cloud, firewall configuration, static ips, ssh, dns configuration, ssl certificates). Introduction to distributed applet execution environments (kubernetes), basic entities (nodes, pods, deployments, services, ingress). Management tools for the kubernetes platform (kubectl, k9s, lens). Using microk8s for deployment of an application based on microservices. Tools for monitoring (prometheus), alerting and logging (elasticsearch-fluentd-kibana). Management of applets (servicemesh, application gateways).
